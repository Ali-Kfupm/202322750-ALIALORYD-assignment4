## Dynamic Content
A dynamic filtering system was implemented for the Projects section.

Users can select a category from a dropdown menu, and the displayed projects update instantly based on the selection. The filtering logic is data-driven, using project categories defined in a separate data file.

If no projects match the selected category, a message is displayed to inform the user.

---

## Data Handling
A dark/light theme toggle was implemented using JavaScript and localStorage.

When the user changes the theme, the selected preference is saved in localStorage. On future visits or page refreshes, the website reads the saved value and automatically applies the user’s preferred theme.

---

## Animation and Transitions
Smooth transitions were added to the project cards during filtering.

When a user selects a category, project cards fade in and out instead of appearing or disappearing abruptly. This improves the overall user experience and provides a more polished interface.

---

## Error Handling and User Feedback
The application provides clear feedback and validation:

- Form inputs are validated before submission
- Email format is checked
- Error messages are displayed when inputs are invalid
- A success message is shown after submission
- A message appears when no projects match the selected category
